# Quick Start Guide

Get your FinTech Support Chatbot running in under 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- uv package manager

## Installation

### 1. Install uv

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd finance_app

# Run setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Edit `.env`:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
OPENAI_AGENT_ID=wf-your-agent-id
```

Don't have an Agent ID yet? See [AGENT_SETUP.md](AGENT_SETUP.md)

### 4. Run the App

```bash
# Using the dev script
./dev.sh

# Or manually with uv
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 5. Open Browser

Visit: **http://localhost:8000**

Click the chat button (ðŸ’¬) and start chatting!

## First Time Setup

If you don't have an OpenAI Agent yet:

1. Follow [AGENT_SETUP.md](AGENT_SETUP.md) to create your agent
2. Copy the Agent ID
3. Add it to `.env`
4. Restart the application

## Testing

Try these queries:

âœ… **"How do I withdraw funds?"**  
Tests knowledge base search

âœ… **"Calculate compound interest on $5,000 at 5% for 2 years"**  
Tests calculation tools

âœ… **"What's the current price of Bitcoin?"**  
Tests web search

âœ… **"Analyze $10,000 growing to $15,000 in 3 years"**  
Tests investment analysis

## Common Issues

### "Module not found"
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "ChatKit not loading"
- Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Make sure `OPENAI_AGENT_ID` is set in `.env`
- Check browser console for errors

### "No knowledge base found"
The knowledge base auto-initializes on first run. Just wait a moment!
